DESCRIPTION: 

The data is a subset of the The National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey data.

The National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) was sponsored by the 
National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases 
(NCIRD) and conducted jointly by NCIRD and the National 
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC). The NHFS was a list-assisted 
random-digit-dialing telephone survey of households, designed
to monitor influenza immunization coverage in the 2009-10 season.

The target population for the NHFS was all persons 6 months or
older living in the United States at the time of the 
interview. Data from the NHFS were used to produce timely estimates 
of vaccination coverage rates for both the monovalent pH1N1 and
trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines.
